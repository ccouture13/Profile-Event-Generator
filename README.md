## A simple record generator.

Just made this so I can generate CSVs that contain profiles with varying coverage rates for IDs and traits.

#### How to use it:
1) Open this in Visual Studio Code, change the row "count" to the amount of profiles you want.
2) In Visual Studio Code open terminal and type the following.
```
python3 generate.py
```

This is a simplified versio of the last profile generator and I'll update it with additional settings in the future.
